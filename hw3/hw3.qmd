In this exercise, we use tidyverse (ggplot2, dplyr, etc) to explore the [MIMIC-IV](https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/) data introduced in [homework 1](https://ucla-biostat-203b.github.io/2024winter/hw/hw1/hw1.html) and to build a cohort of ICU stays.

## Q1. Visualizing patient trajectory

Visualizing a patient's encounters in a health care system is a common task in clinical data analysis. In this question, we will visualize a patient's ADT (admission-discharge-transfer) history and ICU vitals in the MIMIC-IV data.

### Q1.1 ADT history

A patient's ADT history records the time of admission, discharge, and transfer in the hospital. This figure shows the ADT history of the patient with `subject_id` 10001217 in the MIMIC-IV data. The x-axis is the calendar time, and the y-axis is the type of event (ADT, lab, procedure). The color of the line segment represents the care unit. The size of the line segment represents whether the care unit is an ICU/CCU. The crosses represent lab events, and the shape of the dots represents the type of procedure. The title of the figure shows the patient's demographic information and the subtitle shows top 3 diagnoses.

![](10001217_adt.png)
Do a similar visualization for the patient with `subject_id` 10013310 using ggplot.

Hint: We need to pull information from data files `patients.csv.gz`, `admissions.csv.gz`, `transfers.csv.gz`, `labevents.csv.gz`, `procedures_icd.csv.gz`, `diagnoses_icd.csv.gz`, `d_icd_procedures.csv.gz`, and `d_icd_diagnoses.csv.gz`. For the big file `labevents.csv.gz`, use the Parquet format you generated in Homework 2. For reproducibility, make the Parquet folder `labevents_pq` available at the current working directory `hw3`, for example, by a symbolic link. Make your code reproducible.

Patient of interest:
```{r}
sid <- 10013310
```

Import 'transfers.csv.gz' as a tibble `sid_adt`. 
```{r}

### Q1.2 ICU stays

ICU stays are a subset of ADT history. This figure shows the vitals of the patient `10001217` during ICU stays. The x-axis is the calendar time, and the y-axis is the value of the vital. The color of the line represents the type of vital. The facet grid shows the abbreviation of the vital and the stay ID.

![](10001217_icu.png)

Do a similar visualization for the patient `10013310`.

Import 'icustays.csv.gz' as a tibble `sid_icustays`. 
```{r}
sid_icustays <- read_csv("~/mimic/icu/icustays.csv.gz") |>

```

Here is my plot:

![](q2_plot.png)

## Q2. ICU stays

`icustays.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/icu/icustays/>) contains data about Intensive Care Units (ICU) stays. The first 10 lines are
```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/icu/icustays.csv.gz | head
```

### Q2.1 Ingestion

Import `icustays.csv.gz` as a tibble `icustays_tble`. 

```{r}
icustays_tble <- read_csv("~/mimic/icu/icustays.csv.gz") |>
  print(width = Inf)
```

### Q2.2 Summary and visualization

How many unique `subject_id`? Can a `subject_id` have multiple ICU stays? Summarize the number of ICU stays per `subject_id` by graphs. 

```{r}
icustays_tble %>%
  distinct(subject_id) %>%
  count()
```

- There are 50920 unique `subject_id`.

- A `subject_id` can have multiple ICU stays:
```{r}
icu_stays_summary <- icustays_tble %>%
  group_by(subject_id) %>%
  summarise(num_icu_stays = n())
icu_stays_summary
```


```{r}
icu_stays_summary %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = num_icu_stays)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 10, by = 1)) +
  labs(
    title = "Number of ICU Stays per Patient",
    x = "Number of ICU Stays",
    y = "Count"
  )
```

## Q3. `admissions` data

Information of the patients admitted into hospital is available in `admissions.csv.gz`. See <https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/hosp/admissions/> for details of each field in this file. The first 10 lines are
```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/admissions.csv.gz | head
```

### Q3.1 Ingestion

Import `admissions.csv.gz` as a tibble `admissions_tble`.

```{r}
admissions_tble <- read_csv("~/mimic/hosp/admissions.csv.gz") |>
  print(width = Inf)

ad_summary <- admissions_tble %>%
  group_by(subject_id) %>%
  summarise(num_hadm_id = n())
```

### Q3.2 Summary and visualization

Summarize the following information by graphics and explain any patterns you see.

- number of admissions per patient  
- admission hour (anything unusual?)  
- admission minute (anything unusual?)  
- length of hospital stay (from admission to discharge) (anything unusual?) 

#### Number of admissions per patient  
```{r}
admissions_tble %>%
  group_by(subject_id) %>%
  summarise(num_hadm_id = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = num_hadm_id)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 250, by = 10)) +
  labs(
    title = "Number of Admissions per Patient",
    x = "Number of Admissions",
    y = "Count"
  )
```
```{r}
mean(ad_summary$num_hadm_id)
median(ad_summary$num_hadm_id)
sum(ad_summary$num_hadm_id == 1) / nrow(ad_summary)
```
Over a half of the patients have only one admission, but the outliers have more than 100 or even 200 admissions.

This situation is likely representative of a population where most people are generally healthy and require hospitalization only occasionally, while a smaller group deals with chronic illnesses or other issues leading to frequent hospital visits.

#### Admission hour
```{r}
admissions_tble %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = hour(admittime))) +
  geom_bar(fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(
    title = "Admission Hour",
    x = "Hour",
    y = "Count"
  )
```
Admission hours exhibit a predominant concentration during the afternoon and evening.

There is a noticeable decline in admissions during the early morning hours.

Despite this trend, a notable peak is observed at 7 a.m which is unusual. I think this is due to the fact that the hospital staff are changing shifts at this time, and the new staff are admitting patients who have been waiting for a bed overnight.

Midnight is the peak of all time, indicating potential administrative protocols or a default timestamp for admissions occurring late at night.

#### Admission minute 
```{r}
admissions_tble %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = minute(admittime))) +
  geom_bar(fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(
    title = "Admission Minute",
    x = "Minute",
    y = "Count"
  )
```
Admission minutes exhibit a peak every 15 minutes and the peaks are decreasing as the minute increases.

Other miuntes are relatively evenly distributed.

This may be due to some certain procedures or administrative protocols.

#### Length of hospital stay (from admission to discharge)
```{r}
admissions_tble %>%
  mutate(los = as.numeric(difftime(dischtime, admittime, units = "days"))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = los)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 250, by = 10)) +
  labs(
    title = "Length of Hospital Stay",
    x = "Length of Hospital Stay (days)",
    y = "Count"
  )
```
This distribution underscores the diversity in the duration of hospital stays, with most being short and only a minority being notably prolonged.

According to the [MIMIC-IV documentation](https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/about/concepts/#date-shifting), 

> All dates in the database have been shifted to protect patient confidentiality. Dates will be internally consistent for the same patient, but randomly distributed in the future. Dates of birth which occur in the present time are not true dates of birth. Furthermore, dates of birth which occur before the year 1900 occur if the patient is older than 89. In these cases, the patient’s age at their first admission has been fixed to 300.

## Q4. `patients` data

Patient information is available in `patients.csv.gz`. See <https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/hosp/patients/> for details of each field in this file. The first 10 lines are
```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/patients.csv.gz | head
```

### Q4.1 Ingestion

Import `patients.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/hosp/patients/>) as a tibble `patients_tble`.

```{r}
patients_tble <- read_csv("~/mimic/hosp/patients.csv.gz") |>
  print(width = Inf)
```
### Q4.2 Summary and visualization

Summarize variables `gender` and `anchor_age` by graphics, and explain any patterns you see.

```{r}
library(patchwork)
gender_summary <- patients_tble %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
  summarise(count = n())

# Bar plot for gender
Q4_plot1 <- ggplot(gender_summary, aes(x = gender, y = count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(
    title = "Gender Distribution",
    x = "Gender",
    y = "Count"
  )

# Histogram for anchor age
Q4_plot2 <- ggplot(patients_tble, aes(x = anchor_age)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(
    title = "Histogram of Anchor Age",
    x = "Anchor Age",
    y = "Frequency"
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, by = 10))

Q4_plot1 + Q4_plot2
```
Females are slightly more than hald of the patients.

The peak appears at younger adults, and a decline as the age increases to middle age. 

It starts increasing after 40 years old and reaches the second peak at around 55 years old.

As age increases, there is a corresponding decline in the patient count,  aligning with the expectation that not all patients may survive into older age groups.

## Q5. Lab results

`labevents.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/hosp/labevents/>) contains all laboratory measurements for patients. The first 10 lines are
```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/labevents.csv.gz | head
```

`d_labitems.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/hosp/d_labitems/>) is the dictionary of lab measurements. 
```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/d_labitems.csv.gz | head
```

We are interested in the lab measurements of creatinine (50912), potassium (50971), sodium (50983), chloride (50902), bicarbonate (50882), hematocrit (51221), white blood cell count (51301), and glucose (50931). Retrieve a subset of `labevents.csv.gz` that only containing these items for the patients in `icustays_tble`. Further restrict to the last available measurement (by `storetime`) before the ICU stay. The final `labevents_tble` should have one row per ICU stay and columns for each lab measurement.

![](labevents_tble.png)

Hint: Use the Parquet format you generated in Homework 2. For reproducibility, make `labevents_pq` folder available at the current working directory `hw3`, for example, by a symbolic link.

Import 'd_labitems.csv.gz' as a tibble `d_labitems`. 

```{r}
d_labitems <- read_csv("~/mimic/hosp/d_labitems.csv.gz") |>
  print(width = Inf)
```

```{r}
labevents_tble <- arrow::open_dataset("labevents.parquet") %>%
  dplyr::filter(subject_id %in% icustays_tble$subject_id) %>%
  dplyr::filter(itemid %in% c(
    50912, 50971, 50983, 50902,
    50882, 51221, 51301, 50931
  )) %>%
  select(subject_id, itemid, storetime, valuenum) %>%
  collect() %>%
  left_join(icustays_tble, by = "subject_id") %>%
  select(subject_id, stay_id, itemid, valuenum, storetime, intime) %>%
  filter(storetime < intime) %>%
  group_by(subject_id, stay_id, itemid) %>%
  arrange(storetime, .by_group = TRUE) %>%
  slice_tail(n = 1) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(subject_id, stay_id, itemid, valuenum) %>%
  left_join(d_labitems, by = "itemid") %>%
  select(subject_id, stay_id, label, valuenum) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = label, values_from = valuenum) %>%
  print(width = Inf)
```


## Q6. Vitals from charted events

`chartevents.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/icu/chartevents/>) contains all the charted data available for a patient. During their ICU stay, the primary repository of a patient’s information is their electronic chart. The `itemid` variable indicates a single measurement type in the database. The `value` variable is the value measured for `itemid`. The first 10 lines of `chartevents.csv.gz` are
```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/icu/chartevents.csv.gz | head
```

`d_items.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/icu/d_items/>) is the dictionary for the `itemid` in `chartevents.csv.gz`. 
```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/icu/d_items.csv.gz | head
```

We are interested in the vitals for ICU patients: heart rate (220045), systolic non-invasive blood pressure (220179), diastolic non-invasive blood pressure (220180), body temperature in Fahrenheit (223761), and respiratory rate (220210). Retrieve a subset of `chartevents.csv.gz` only containing these items for the patients in `icustays_tble`. Further restrict to the first vital measurement within the ICU stay. The final `chartevents_tble` should have one row per ICU stay and columns for each vital measurement. 

![](chartevents_tble.png)

Hint: Use the Parquet format you generated in Homework 2. For reproducibility, make `chartevents_pq` folder available at the current working directory, for example, by a symbolic link.


Import 'd_items.csv.gz' as a tibble `d_items`. 

```{r}
d_items <- read_csv("~/mimic/icu/d_items.csv.gz") |>
  print(width = Inf)
```


```{r}
chartevents_tble <- arrow::open_dataset("chartevents.parquet") %>%
  filter(itemid %in% c(220045, 220179, 220180, 223761, 220210)) %>%
  select(stay_id, charttime, itemid, valuenum) %>%
  collect()

join_tbl2 <- icustays_tble %>%
  select(subject_id, stay_id, intime) %>%
  left_join(chartevents_tble, by = "stay_id") %>%
  filter(charttime >= intime) %>%
  group_by(subject_id, stay_id, itemid) %>%
  slice_min(order_by = charttime) %>%
  ungroup()

chartevents_tble <- join_tbl2 %>%
  select(subject_id, stay_id, itemid, valuenum) %>%
  left_join(d_items, by = "itemid") %>%
  select(subject_id, stay_id, label, valuenum) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = label, values_from = valuenum, values_fn = mean) %>%
  print(width = Inf)
```

## Q7. Putting things together

Let us create a tibble `mimic_icu_cohort` for all ICU stays, where rows are all ICU stays of adults (age at `intime` >= 18) and columns contain at least following variables

- all variables in `icustays_tble`  
- all variables in `admissions_tble`  
- all variables in `patients_tble`
- the last lab measurements before the ICU stay in `labevents_tble` 
- the first vital measurements during the ICU stay in `chartevents_tble`

The final `mimic_icu_cohort` should have one row per ICU stay and columns for each variable.

![](mimic_icu_cohort.png)

```{r}
mimic_icu_cohort <-
  icustays_tble %>%
  left_join(admissions_tble, by = c("subject_id", "hadm_id")) %>%
  left_join(patients_tble, by = "subject_id") %>%
  mutate(intimeage = year(intime) - anchor_year + anchor_age) %>%
  filter(intimeage >= 18) %>%
  left_join(labevents_tble, by = c("subject_id", "stay_id")) %>%
  left_join(chartevents_tble, by = c("subject_id", "stay_id")) %>%
  print(width = Inf)
```


## Q8. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Summarize the following information about the ICU stay cohort `mimic_icu_cohort` using appropriate numerics or graphs:

### Length of ICU stay `los` vs demographic variables (race, insurance, marital_status, gender, age at intime)

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### `los` vs `race`
```{r}
mimic_icu_cohort %>%
  group_by(race) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_los = mean(los),
    median_los = median(los),
    sum_los = sum(los),
    sd_los = sd(los)
  ) %>%
  print(width = Inf) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sum_los, y = race)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue") +
  labs(title = "Total Length of ICU stay vs Race", x = "", y = "")
```

```{r, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 6}
ggplot(mimic_icu_cohort, aes(x = los, y = race)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Length of ICU stay vs Demographic Variables", x = "Race", y = "Length of ICU Stay") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, max(mimic_icu_cohort$los), by = 3))
```

The length of ICU stay shows little variation across different races, typically within a day.

The White people had the longest total ICU stays and the second is African American. This is consistent with the fact that the White people are the majority of the population in the US.

#### `los` vs `insurance`

```{r}
mimic_icu_cohort %>%
  group_by(insurance) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_los = mean(los),
    median_los = median(los),
    sum_los = sum(los),
    sd_los = sd(los)
  ) %>%
  print(width = Inf)
```

```{r plot-wider-bigger, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 3}
ggplot(

It seems that the length of ICU stay is similar across different insurance types. 

Patients with Medicare have longest total ICU stays than those with Medicaid which may suggest Medicare is more likely to be used by patients.

Patients with 'Other' insurance type have the longest total ICU stays which may suggest a need for further investigation and more specific categorization.

#### `los` vs `marital_status`
```{r}
mimic_icu_cohort %>%
  filter(!is.na(marital_status)) %>%
  group_by(marital_status) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_los = mean(los, na.rm = TRUE),
    median_los = median(los, na.rm = TRUE),
    min_los = min(los, na.rm = TRUE),
    max_los = max(los, na.rm = TRUE),
    sum_los = sum(los, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_los = sd(los, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

```{r plot wider, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 3}

  ))
```

```{r}

  labs(title = "Total Length of ICU stay vs Marital Status", 
       x = "Marital Status", y = "Total Length of ICU Stay")
```
It seems not much difference in the length of ICU stay across different marital status.

The married patients have a slightly wider distribution of ICU stays and more outliers than the other groups. 

#### `los` vs `gender`

```{r}
mimic_icu_cohort %>%
  filter(!is.na(gender)) %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_los = mean(los, na.rm = TRUE),
    median_los = median(los, na.rm = TRUE),
    min_los = min(los, na.rm = TRUE),
    max_los = max(los, na.rm = TRUE),
    sum_los = sum(los, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_los = sd(los, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

```{r plot-wider, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 3}
ggplot(
  mimic_icu_cohort %>% filter(!is.na(gender)),
  aes(x = los, y = gender)
) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    title = "Length of ICU stay vs Gender",
    x = "Length of ICU Stay", y = ""
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, max(mimic_icu_cohort$los),
    by = 2
  ))
```
```{r}
ggplot(mimic_icu_cohort %>%
  filter(!is.na(gender)), aes(x = gender, y = los)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", color = "skyblue") +
  labs(
    title = "Total Length of ICU stay vs Gender",
    x = "Gender", y = "Total Length of ICU Stay"
  )
```

Male have a slightly wider distribution of ICU stays and more outliers than female. 

Male patients also have longer total ICU stays.


#### `los` vs `age at intime`

```{r}
mimic_icu_cohort %>%
  filter(!is.na(intimeage)) %>%
  group_by(intimeage) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_los = mean(los),
    median_los = median(los),
    sum_los = sum(los),
    sd_los = sd(los)
  ) %>%
  print(width = Inf)
```

```{r}
ggplot(mimic_icu_cohort %>%
  filter(!is.na(intimeage)), aes(x = intimeage, y = los)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(
    title = "Length of ICU stay vs Age at Intime",
    x = "Age at Intime", y = "Length of ICU Stay"
  )
```

The graph shows a steady increase in ICU stay length up to around age 75, followed by a sharp decline.

### Length of ICU stay `los` vs the last available lab measurements before ICU stay

```{r, fig.width = 15, fig.height = 9}
mimic_icu_cohort %>%
  select(
    Bicarbonate, Chloride, Creatinine,
    Glucose, Potassium, Sodium,
    Hematocrit, `White Blood Cells`, los
  ) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -los,
    names_to = "abbreviation",
    values_to = "value"
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(
    x = los, y = value,
    color = abbreviation,
    group = abbreviation
  )) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(abbreviation ~ ., scales = "free") +
  labs(
    x = "Length of ICU Stay", y = "",

  ) +
  guides(color = FALSE) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, max(mimic_icu_cohort$los),
    by = 5
  ))
```


Most data points are concentrated at lower levels of the last available lab measurements before ICU stay, and correspond to shorter lengths of ICU stay.

This indicates that the majority of patients have lower levels of the last available lab measurements before ICU stay, and require shorter ICU stays.

However, in some cases of abnormal lab measurements, we observe some exceptionally long ICU stays, which may be outliers.

These outliers may represent patients with specific conditions leading to abnormal lab measurements and prolonged ICU stays.


### Length of ICU stay `los` vs the first vital measurements within the ICU stay

```{r, fig.width = 15, fig.height = 9}
mimic_icu_cohort %>%

    "Heart Rate", "Non Invasive Blood Pressure systolic",
    "Non Invasive Blood Pressure diastolic",
    "Respiratory Rate",
    "Temperature Fahrenheit", los
  ) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -los,
    names_to = "abbreviation",
    values_to = "value"
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(
    x = los, y = value,
    color = abbreviation,
    group = abbreviation
  )) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(abbreviation ~ ., scales = "free") +
  labs(
    x = "Length of ICU Stay", y = "",
    color = "Type of Measurement",

  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, max(mimic_icu_cohort$los),
    by = 5
  ))
```

Patients with lower heart rates typically have shorter ICU hospital stays, but individual patients may experience abnormally high heart rates due to specific clinical conditions, leading to longer hospital stays.

Most patients have blood pressure within the normal range, corresponding to shorter ICU hospitalization time. However, extremely high blood pressure may reflect serious medical conditions and further confirmation of accuracy is needed.

Mild increase in respiratory rate is usually associated with shorter ICU hospitalization time, but abnormally high respiratory rate may be associated with more severe disease conditions that require longer ICU treatment.

Normal or slightly elevated body temperature is usually associated with shorter ICU hospitalization time, while abnormally high body temperature may be associated with more severe disease conditions, leading to longer ICU monitoring time.

- In order to reduce the impact of outliers on the overall graph and better display the distribution of data,

I use a log scale for the y-axis.

- Neuro Surgical Intensive Care Unit (Neuro SICU) has longer average ICU stay and larger variation than other units . 

This may be due to the fact that patients in Neuro SICU are more likely to have severe conditions and require longer ICU stays.

- Outliers in units like Trauma SICU, Surgical ICU, Medical ICU, and Cardiac Vascular ICU have notably longer ICU stays, sometimes exceeding 100 days—twice the maximum observed in Neuro Intermediate and three times that of Neuro Stepdown units. 

This likely reflects the complexity and severity of conditions treated in these specialized units.
